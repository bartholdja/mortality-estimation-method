Example ode to estimate mortality for both sexes in species with sex-biased natal dispersal

Start by opening Code S2 and reading the instruction therein.

The files in this repository are:

Code S1: Simulates data
Code S2: Fits the mortality model in a Bayesian hierarchical framework.
simFct: contains the necessary functions
plotDipsPdf: plots the probability density function of age at natal dispersal
plotMortRate: plots the age-specific mortality rates for both sexes
plotTraces: plots the traces of the MCMC
